The task:
The company requires a solution for monthly time management that can summarize working hours for each employee within a given timespan.

Create a C# solution that summarizes the input data found in the TimeRegistrations.csv file by implementing the ITimeTracker interface.

A former employee has started a 'nice' class for you, however, apart from the interfaces, you are free to design your solution however you see fit.
